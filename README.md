The project Scrabble Book is similar to the Scrabble game (in the Hebrew version). The players will have to put together words that intersect with each other like in a crossword puzzle and accumulate points. However, the legal words in the game are not all the words in the English dictionary, but only words that appear in the Scrabble book chosen for the game. Also it is built in some generic server that will allow the user to play in front of the server.
